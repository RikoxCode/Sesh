# Sesh-PA-QV-Documentation
Sesh is a mono-repo for managing PA/QV documentation. It includes setup for ESLint, Prettier, Husky hooks, branching rules, GitHub workflows (CI/CD), and issue/PR templates. This serves as the foundation for future implementations (React/Laravel) with Keycloak integration.
